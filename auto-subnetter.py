# For those of you who is working on the 4 bonuspoint subnet design program (Python)
# If you are working on this program, please make sure you implement the following regarding input of parameters.
# These parameters can be put either in a file (name of which becomes the parameters to the program, when you start it),
# or can be typed in, after the program starts. If the program starts without a file-name input parameter, then the program asks for it.
# 1st line, base subnet address: a.b.c.d/n
# 2nd line, subnet sizes in any order: n1, n2 n3 n4, n5   # number are separated either by a comma "," or space " ", or both
# If the program reads the parameters from a file, then any line starting with a hash "#" is considered a comment and ignored.
# Once you have completed your program, please set up a time with me to show me in my office.
# Thank you all and good luck.
